# particle simulation

### Javascript vs Java
For this project, the code you are writing will look a little less similar to java. Loops, if statements, returns, mathmatical expressions are all the same. 
Same as the last project, all variables should be declared with the `let` keyword instead of int, double, or String. 

Classes look a little bit different in javascript. See the javascript class resource below to learn more about the differences in syntax.
